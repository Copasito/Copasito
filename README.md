# Jorge Figueroa Soto 👨‍💻

## About me

Greetings! I am Jorge Figueroa, a passionate **software engineer and computer scientist** graduated from [Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali](https://www.javerianacali.edu.co/programas/carreras/ingenieria-de-sistemas-y-computacion). I strongly believe that any knowledge can be acquired with time and a proper approach. Currently, I am focused on **test automation** and the application of **artificial intelligence** in this process. 🚀

## Skills

- Python 🐍
- C & C++ 🖥️
- Machine learning 🤖
- Data analysis 📊
- Teamwork & Leadership 👥
- Adaptability to change 🔄
- Creativity 💡

## Hobbies and Interests 💪💬🎲

My hobbies include going to the gym💪 for 5-6 days a week and hanging out with my friends for long conversations💬 or playing board games🎲.

## Goals and Inspiration 🎯🌱🏆

I would like to learn techniques for improving **software quality**🏅 and reducing failure in technology projects. I firmly believe that the latter is possible through the implementation of rigorous testing processes in the early stages of the software development life cycle. Additionally, I believe that **artificial intelligence**🤖 tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot should not be seen as a threat to programmers, but rather as tools that provide support to developers. I am convinced that their use can enhance our skills and streamline the development process, allowing us to focus on more creative and challenging tasks.
